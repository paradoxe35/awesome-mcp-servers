## Description
bitcoin-mcp is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that facilitates interaction with the Bitcoin and Lightning Networks. It enables AI models and agent frameworks to generate keys, validate addresses, decode transactions, query blockchain data, and perform related Bitcoin and Lightning Network operations. It is designed as a strong example of an MCP server and is suitable for integration with AI platforms such as Claude Desktop and Goose.

## Features
- **Bitcoin & Lightning Network Support**: Interact with both the Bitcoin and Lightning networks.
- **Key Generation**: Generate cryptographic keys for Bitcoin.
- **Address Validation**: Validate Bitcoin addresses for correctness.
- **Transaction Decoding**: Decode Bitcoin transactions to extract relevant information.
- **Blockchain Data Retrieval**: Query the Bitcoin blockchain for data such as latest block, transactions by TXID, and more.
- **Lightning Network Integration (Optional)**: Configure and interact with the Lightning Network via LNBits (optional setup required).
- **AI Agent Integration**: Designed for use with AI models and agent frameworks such as Claude Desktop (Anthropic) and Goose (Block), supporting both local (STDIO) and remote (SSE) extension modes.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Implements custom error types and detailed logging (using Pino) for debugging and error transparency.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the MIT License; contributions are welcome.
- **API Reference and Development Setup**: Detailed documentation for available tools and development environment setup is provided.

## Integrations
- **Claude Desktop**: Step-by-step instructions to integrate with Anthropic's Claude Desktop application to enable AI-powered Bitcoin queries.
- **Goose**: Supports integration with the Goose AI agent framework, both as a local command-line extension or remote SSE extension.
