## Description
**fledge-mcp** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges the Fledge IoT platform with natural language interfaces, enabling sensor data access, system management, and real-time visualization. It is designed for integration with Cursor AI, allowing AI-driven interactions with Fledge instances using natural language commands. The server implements the MCP protocol directly, using JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket, and supports deployment in containerized environments.

## Features
- **MCP Server Implementation:** Fully implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket.
- **Natural Language Interface:** Enables AI (e.g., Cursor AI) to interact with Fledge via natural language commands.
- **Data Access and Management:** Tools for accessing and managing sensor data from Fledge.
- **Service Control:** Provides control over Fledge services.
- **Frontend Code Generation:** Supports generation of frontend code for visualization or interaction.
- **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Streams real-time sensor data via WebSocket.
- **Debugging and Validation:** Tools for debugging and validating API connections and functionality.
- **Documentation and Schema:** Methods to retrieve available tools and their parameters.
- **Security Options:** Optional API key authentication for secure server operation.
- **Containerized Deployment:** Includes Dockerfile for easy container-based deployment.
- **Extensibility:** Can be extended with additional tools and features.
- **Production Deployment:** Supports deployment and management on Smithery.ai, with configuration, monitoring, and update workflows.
- **Error Handling:** Adheres to standard JSON-RPC 2.0 error codes.
