## Description
GitHub Copilot MCP is an official Model Context Protocol (MCP) server by Microsoft that allows GitHub Copilot to detect security flaws and auto-generate pull requests using MCP workflows. It integrates with VS Code Agent Mode to enable AI-driven, autonomous coding workflows.

## Features
- **MCP Protocol Support:** Implements the open Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing standardized integration with AI models and external tools.
- **Agent Mode Integration:** Supports GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode in VS Code, enabling Copilot to plan steps, gather context, execute terminal commands, and perform complex tasks.
- **Server Installation Options:**
  - Manual configuration via `.vscode/mcp.json` or `settings.json`.
  - Command-line installation with `--add-mcp` option.
  - Command Palette installation with the "MCP: Add Server" command.
  - Installation via VS Code URL handler.
- **Flexible Server Connections:**
  - Run local commands (stdio).
  - Connect to remote servers via HTTP (SSE).
  - Install from NPM/PIP packages or run from Docker images.
- **Import MCP Servers:**
  - Import configurations from Claude Desktop, Cline, and Roo Code applications.
- **Shared Configurations:**
  - Workspace-level sharing of MCP server setups for teams.
  - User-level global configurations.
- **Advanced Configuration:**
  - Define command, arguments, environment variables, input placeholders, environment files, and HTTP headers.
  - Secure handling of sensitive data via input prompts.
- **Server Management:**
