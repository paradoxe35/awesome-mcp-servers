## Description
Claude Server is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to enhance Claude's context management capabilities.

- **Automatic Configuration:** Integrates with the Claude desktop app's MCP settings for seamless setup.
- **Configurable:** Settings managed via `claude_desktop_config.json` in the user's Application Support directory.

## Installation
