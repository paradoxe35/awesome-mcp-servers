## Features
- **Decentralized Compute Marketplace:** Users can buy and sell compute resources in a secure, efficient, and censorship-resistant environment.
- **Open-source:** The entire network and its orchestration layer are open-source, licensed under Apache 2.0.
- **Community Powered:** Anyone can participate as a provider (offering hardware) or as a user (deploying workloads).
- **Transparent Pricing:** Uses a 'Reverse Auction' system for cost control, often offering prices up to 85% lower than traditional cloud providers.
- **Blockchain Auditability:** Secured by the AKT utility token, with all transactions and deployments auditable on-chain.
- **Cosmos SDK & IBC:** Built on Cosmos SDK, enabling IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) for seamless connectivity with other blockchains.
- **Privacy & Security:** Supports anonymous application deployment, safeguarding user identity.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Uses SDL for orchestration, supporting intricate deployments across multiple regions and providers.
- **Kubernetes Powered:** Built on Kubernetes for reliability, scalability, and security.
- **Persistent Storage:** Offers persistent, limitless storage, suitable for data-intensive applications.
- **Dedicated IP Leasing:** Supports leasing dedicated IPs for custom port assignments, aiding DNS/web servers.
- **Permissionless:** Open and accessible for anyone to deploy apps or become a provider.
- **Peer-to-Peer & Private:** Ensures data privacy and payment transparency with peer-to-peer architecture.
- **Supports AI/ML Workloads:** Examples include running large language models (LLMs), text-to-image generation, and Ray clusters for parallel computing.
- **Integrations:** Compatible with tools like Jupyter notebooks (via Brev.dev), Venice AI, and supports projects like Nous Research and Presearch.
- **Dev Tools:** Provides Akash Console (for deployment), Provider Console (for offering resources), and SDL deployment templates.
- **Global Resource Access:** Ability to scale and access a global array of compute and storage services.
