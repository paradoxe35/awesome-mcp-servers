## Category
- Development Tools / MCP Servers

## Features
- Implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for developer tooling
- Provides LLMs/AI Agents with LSP-like capabilities, enabling language-aware context extraction from codebases
- Supports integration with tools such as Claude Desktop and Cursor
- Can be run using Docker or via npx
- Allows configuration via config files (e.g., claude_desktop_config.json for Claude Desktop, ~/.llm/config.json for MCP CLI Client)
- Currently supports the use of one language server at a time (multiple LSPs not yet supported)
- Designed as a proof of concept to demonstrate MCP server extensibility
