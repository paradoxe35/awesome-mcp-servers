## Description
The MongoDB Atlas MCP Adapter is a community-supported adapter that connects MongoDB Atlas (as well as self-managed MongoDB deployments) to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This enables seamless, no-code synchronization and integration with a variety of MCP-enabled tools and clients, facilitating fast and context-aware data operations using natural language and AI agents.

## Features
- **MCP Protocol Support:** Implements the Model Context Protocol, an open standard for connecting AI agents and data systems.
- **Broad MongoDB Deployment Compatibility:** Connects to MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Community Edition, and MongoDB Enterprise Advanced.
- **Two-way Communication:** Enables MCP-supported clients (such as Windsurf, Cursor, GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Anthropicâ€™s Claude) to interact with MongoDB databases.
- **Natural Language Operations:** Allows users to perform database queries and administrative tasks using natural language prompts (e.g., exploring schemas, finding records, managing users, listing network rules).
- **Database Administration:** Supports administrative tasks such as cluster management and user access control through AI agents.
- **Context-aware Code Generation:** Facilitates the generation of MongoDB queries and application code via AI tools, using schema and data context to reduce inaccuracies.
- **No-code Integration:** Enables integration and synchronization with other MCP-enabled tools without custom code.
- **Data Exploration:** AI agents can explore and analyze data directly within development environments, minimizing context switching.
- **Real-time Data Access:** Provides up-to-date and contextually relevant data to AI agents and tools.
- **Out-of-the-box Integration:** Available as a pre-integrated option in tools like Windsurf for immediate use.
- **Open Source and Community-driven:** Public preview available; feedback and enhancements are encouraged via GitHub.
