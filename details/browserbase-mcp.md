## Description
Browserbase MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables cloud browser automation using Browserbase, Puppeteer, and (coming soon) Stagehand.

- **Cloud Browser Automation:** Control and orchestrate cloud browsers for automated tasks.
- **Data Extraction:** Extract structured data from any webpage.
- **Console Monitoring:** Track and analyze browser console logs in real time.
- **Screenshots:** Capture full-page and element-specific screenshots.
- **JavaScript Execution:** Run custom JavaScript code within the browser context.
- **Web Interaction:** Automate navigation, clicking, and form filling on web pages.
- **MCP Integration:** Provides a standardized protocol for LLMs to interact with external web data and tools.
- **(Planned) Stagehand Support:** Additional features such as atomic instructions, vision support, and modular model integration are planned with Stagehand MCP.
