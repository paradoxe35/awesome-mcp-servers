## Description

codebase-mcp is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that integrates with RepoMix to enable retrieval and analysis of entire codebases. It is designed to provide tools for code review, documentation generation, and to assist AI agents (such as Cursor's Composer Agent) in understanding and working with large codebases efficiently.

## Features

- MCP server implementation compatible with RepoMix
- Enables retrieval and analysis of entire codebases
- Provides three main tools:
  - `getCodebase`: Retrieve a local codebase
  - `getRemoteCodebase`: Retrieve a remote codebase
  - `saveCodebase`: Save a codebase
- Integration with AI agents (e.g., Cursor's Composer Agent) to allow them to read and understand entire codebases automatically
- Usable both within Cursor and with any MCP-compatible client
- Can be started in standard input/output (stdio) mode for client integration
- Open-source under the MIT license
