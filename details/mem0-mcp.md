## Description
Mem0 MCP is an MCP server that integrates with Mem0.ai to efficiently manage coding preferences, snippets, and programming knowledge for AI agents. It allows for storing, retrieving, and semantically searching coding-related data with contextual information, enhancing memory and reasoning capabilities for agents. Mem0 MCP is designed to work with the Cursor code editor and supports persistent connections using SSE (Server-Sent Events).

## Features
- **Integration with Mem0.ai:** Store, retrieve, and semantically search coding preferences, code snippets, and programming knowledge.
- **Persistent FastMCP Server:** Uses SSE connections to allow agents to connect, use, and disconnect as needed, supporting distributed architectures.
- **Comprehensive Context Storage:** When adding coding preferences, the server can store:
  - Complete code with dependencies
  - Language/framework versions
  - Setup instructions
  - Documentation and comments
  - Example usage
  - Best practices
- **Retrieval Tool:** Retrieve all stored coding preferences to review implementations, analyze patterns, and ensure comprehensive knowledge coverage.
- **Semantic Search Tool:** Search stored preferences for code implementations, solutions, setup guides, technical documentation, and best practices.
- **Integration with Cursor Editor:** Easily add the server globally or per-project in Cursor, and access tools via the agent mode.
- **Python-based Server:** Built in Python, with easy setup and installation instructions provided.
- **Customizable Host/Port:** Configure server host and port as needed.

## Installation & Usage
- Requires Git and Python.
- Clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure your Mem0 API key.
- Start the server, and connect via the specified SSE endpoint.
- Integrate with Cursor editor for agent-based workflows.
