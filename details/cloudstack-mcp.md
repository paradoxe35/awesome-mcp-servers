## Description
Cloudstack MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for Apache CloudStack. It enables natural language management of CloudStack infrastructure by translating user requests into API calls. This allows users and AI agents to deploy virtual machines, manage resources, and perform infrastructure operations without needing direct knowledge of the CloudStack API. The project is currently a proof of concept and is under active development.

## Features
- Translates Model Context Protocol (MCP) requests into Apache CloudStack API calls
- Allows AI assistants and agents to interact with and manage CloudStack infrastructure
- Supports common operations such as:
  - Virtual machine (VM) deployment and management
  - Resource management
  - Infrastructure operations (e.g., listing VPCs)
- Handles authentication and API interaction automatically
- Integrates with tools like Cursor for conversational AI-based infrastructure management
- Provides containerized CloudMonkey (CloudStack CLI) usage within the setup
- Example configuration and usage instructions for macOS

## Pricing
- **Open-source** (Apache License 2.0)

## Notes
- The project is a proof of concept and not all features may be available or stable.
