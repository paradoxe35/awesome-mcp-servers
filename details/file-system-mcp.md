## Description
File System MCP is a server that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for local file and directory management. It enables AI assistants, such as Claude, to interact directly with your computer's files and directories for file operations, pattern matching, and workflow automation. All operations are performed locally and require explicit user permission for security.

## Features
- **Direct File System Access:** Enables AI assistants to read, write, edit, move, and organize files and directories on your local machine.
- **Natural Language Commands:** Allows users to manage files using conversational instructions through supported AI interfaces.
- **Configurable Directory Access:** You can specify which directories are accessible and adjust permissions (including read-only modes).
- **Local Processing:** All file operations occur on your local machine; files are not uploaded to remote servers.
- **Security Controls:** Operates only within explicitly authorized directories and requires user approval for actions.
- **Comprehensive File Operations:**
  - `read_file`: Read content of a file
  - `read_multiple_files`: Read multiple files at once
  - `list_directory`: List contents of a directory
  - `search_files`: Recursively search for files matching patterns
  - `get_file_info`: Retrieve file metadata (size, creation time, permissions)
  - `write_file`: Create or overwrite files
  - `edit_file`: Make selective edits using pattern matching
  - `create_directory`: Create or ensure existence of a directory
  - `move_file`: Move or rename files and directories
- **Batch and Workflow Automation:** Automate repetitive file operations, create templates, generate reports, and batch process files.
- **Developer Support:** Useful for organizing code projects, creating boilerplate files, searching code patterns, and making systematic edits.
- **Advanced Configuration:**
  - Docker-based deployment for containerization and advanced permission control
  - Read-only mounting for secure access to sensitive directories
- **Troubleshooting Support:** Guidance for resolving configuration, permission, and connectivity issues.
- **Security Best Practices:** Recommendations for limiting access and regular audits.

## Requirements
- Claude Desktop application (macOS or Windows)
- Node.js installed
- Administrator privileges for installation
- Text editor for configuration
