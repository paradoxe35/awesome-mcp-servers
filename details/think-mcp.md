## Description
think-mcp is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to enhance AI agent reasoning by implementing the "think" tool as described in Anthropic's research. This tool boosts AI context management by allowing explicit structured reasoning steps within agentic workflows.

## Features
- Implements the "think" tool for structured reasoning, inspired by Anthropic's article “The 'think' tool: Enabling Claude to stop and think in complex tool use situations.”
- Allows AI agents to pause and record explicit thoughts during complex reasoning or multi-step tool use.
- Facilitates:
  - Tool output analysis (processing results of previous tool calls)
  - Policy-heavy environments (verifying compliance with guidelines)
  - Sequential decision making (where each step builds on previous ones)
- Minimal, standards-based MCP server using `mcp[cli]`.
- Ready for integration with Claude or other agentic LLMs.
- Tool definition:
  - Input: `thought` (string) — A thought to think about.
  - Behavior: Appends the thought to the log for structured reasoning.
- Advanced mode adds additional tools for agents:
  - Criticize
  - Plan
  - Search
- Open-source under MIT License.
- Implemented in Python.

## Pricing
- Free and open-source (MIT License).
