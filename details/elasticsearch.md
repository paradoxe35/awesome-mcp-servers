# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is a free and open source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It is designed for scalability, speed, and relevance, and can be used as a vector database optimized for production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the core of Elastic’s open Stack platform and is suitable for a wide range of use cases including full-text search, vector search, analytics, and more.

## Features

- **Distributed architecture:** Scalable and fault-tolerant design for handling large datasets and high availability.
- **RESTful API:** Interact with Elasticsearch using HTTP APIs for indexing, searching, and managing data.
- **Search capabilities:** Supports full-text search, vector search, and semantic/natural language search.
- **MCP server integration:** Enables LLMs and other clients to interact with Elasticsearch clusters for managing indices and executing search queries using natural language.
- **Data types:** Supports structured, unstructured, numerical, and geospatial data.
- **Real-time search:** Near real-time indexing and searching of documents.
- **Bulk operations:** Efficiently index or update multiple documents in a single request.
- **Integration with Kibana:** Visualize and explore data, create dashboards, and perform analytics.
- **APIs and clients:** Language clients available for various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).
- **Monitoring and APM:** Collect and analyze logs, metrics, and application performance data.
- **Security features:** Basic authentication, API keys, and more (features depend on license level).
- **Machine learning and AI:** Integrate with generative AI applications, vector search, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases.
- **Extensible via plugins and modules.**
- **Open source:** Licensed under Elastic License.
