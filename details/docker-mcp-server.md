## Description

Docker MCP Server is an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows for secure execution and management of code and environments within Docker containers. It is designed to address common challenges in the deployment and use of AI-powered tools, particularly those that require isolation, automation, and multi-language support.

## Features

- **Containerized Isolation:** Runs MCP tools inside Docker containers, isolating them from the host system and reducing security risks from AI tool execution.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Supports tools written in different programming languages, such as Python and Node.js, without requiring manual environment management.
- **Container Lifecycle Management:** Handles starting, stopping, and managing the lifecycle of containers for individual tools.
- **Script Execution:** Enables execution of scripts and tools in a secure, sandboxed environment.
- **MCP Gateway Functionality:** Acts as a gateway MCP server, allowing dynamic discovery and execution of a wide set of containerized tools without manual configuration changes.
- **MCP Catalog Integration:** Integrates with a Docker MCP Catalog, enabling users to discover, add, and remove tools dynamically through a user interface similar to Docker Hub.
- **Enhanced Security with Docker Secrets:** Leverages Docker Secrets to securely manage sensitive information (such as access tokens) within containers, ensuring secrets are only accessible to the intended tool and not exposed in configuration files.
- **Compatibility:** Ensures compatibility with leading AI platforms and editors such as Claude, Cursor, OpenAI, and VS Code.
- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Eliminates the need for developers to handle multiple language runtimes and dependencies directly on the host system.
- **Centralized Tool Management:** Provides a single point of configuration and access for managing hundreds of MCP tools.
