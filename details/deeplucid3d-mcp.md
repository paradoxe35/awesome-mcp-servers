## Overview
DeepLucid3D MCP is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementing the Unified Cognitive Processing Framework (UCPF). It provides advanced cognitive analysis, creative problem-solving, and structured thinking tools accessible via the MCP protocol. The project is MIT licensed.

## Features
- **Cognitive State Assessment:** Identifies and tracks cognitive states (such as Dark Inertia, Passion, Approaching Lucidity) to support self-awareness during problem-solving.
- **Knowledge Dimension Mapping:** Maps and organizes knowledge across multiple dimensions for improved understanding.
- **Recursive Self-Questioning:** Encourages challenging assumptions and identifying cognitive biases.
- **Creative Perspective Generation:** Produces novel viewpoints and metaphorical thinking to inspire new solutions.
- **Problem Decomposition:** Breaks down complex problems into manageable components and reintegrates them with a holistic view.
- **Optional State Management:** Maintains and manages context between sessions for ongoing analysis and continuity.
- **MCP Protocol Integration:** Compatible with MCP-enabled applications (such as Claude, VSCode with Cline, etc.).
- **Three Main Tools Exposed via MCP:**
  - `analyze_problem`: Processes and analyzes problem statements through the UCPF framework.
  - `creative_exploration`: Generates novel perspectives and connections for topics.
  - `manage_state`: Controls state management for UCPF processing.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Includes framework documentation and use cases (e.g., riddle solving) for practical guidance.
