- **Device Package Management:** Retrieve and manage the list of installed packages on the device, simplifying app management for developers.
- **MCP Client Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with MCP clients like Claude Desktop and supported code editors (e.g., Cursor).
- **Customizable Configuration:** Uses a YAML configuration file to specify the target Android device.
