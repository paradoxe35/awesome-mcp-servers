## Description
Memory Extension is an MCP extension that enables AI agents (such as those in Cursor IDE) to store user preferences, habits, and session-specific information. This allows for personalized interactions and maintains a technical decision trail across multiple sessions. It leverages the Graphiti MCP server, an open-source temporal graph framework, to provide persistent, structured memory for AI-assisted development environments.

## Features
- **Persistent Memory for AI Agents:** Enables AI coding agents to recall and update preferences, coding standards, procedural knowledge, and specifications across sessions.
- **Integration with Cursor IDE:** Specifically demonstrated with Cursor IDE, enabling the agent to remember user and project-specific context.
- **Graphiti Framework:** Uses a temporally-aware knowledge graph to continuously integrate user interactions, structured and unstructured data, and external information.
- **Incremental Data Updates:** Supports efficient updates and retrieval without needing to recompute the entire graph.
- **Precise Historical Queries:** Allows querying of historical data and decisions, supporting context-aware and traceable AI behavior.
- **Custom Entity Definitions:** Supports rich, domain-specific data structures for more precise memory and context management.
- **MCP Server Implementation:** Exposes memory and context management as tools that any compatible AI agent can utilize.
- **Open Standard (MCP):** Utilizes the Model Context Protocol for structured interaction between AI applications and external resources.

## Pricing
No pricing information provided in the available content. The extension appears to be open-source and experimental at this stage.
