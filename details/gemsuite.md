## Description
Gemsuite is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for advanced Gemini API interaction. It features intelligent model selection, providing optimal performance and minimal token cost. Gemsuite integrates with any MCP-compatible host, such as Claude, Cursor, and Replit, and offers advanced file handling and a comprehensive suite of tools for information retrieval, reasoning, processing, and analysis.

## Features
- **Intelligent Model Selection:** Automatically selects the most suitable Gemini model for each task (Gemini 2.0 Flash, Flash-Lite, Flash Thinking) to optimize performance and minimize token usage.
- **Unified File Handling:** Seamlessly processes various file types with automatic format detection.
- **Comprehensive Tool Suite:**
  - `gem_search`: Information retrieval with search integration using Gemini Flash (e.g., factual questions, grounded responses).
  - `gem_reason`: Complex reasoning and step-by-step analysis using Gemini Flash Thinking (e.g., math, science, coding, logical analysis).
  - `gem_process`: Fast, efficient content processing using Gemini Flash-Lite (e.g., summarization, extraction, high-volume operations).
  - `gem_analyze`: Intelligent file analysis with auto-model selection (e.g., document analysis, code review, image understanding).
- **Robust Error Handling:** Ensures stable and reliable operations.
- **Advanced Configuration:** Supports custom model selection by specifying the `model_id` parameter.
- **Production-Ready:** Deployed and validated on platforms such as Smithery.ai, MCP.so, and Glama.io.
- **Integration:** Works with any MCP-compatible host, making the tool suite available directly in the assistant's toolkit.
- **Open-Source:** Licensed under the MIT License.
