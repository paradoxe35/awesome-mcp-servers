# Fly.io

[Fly.io](https://fly.io) is a cloud platform that provides hardware-virtualized containers (Fly Machines) to run full-stack applications and code execution sandboxes globally, close to users. It is designed for real-time and latency-sensitive use cases, including MCP (Model Context Protocol) server deployments.

## Features
- **Global Edge Deployments**: Run containers in 35 regions worldwide on Fly.io's custom-built global cloud.
- **Hardware-Virtualized Containers (Fly Machines)**: Containers are hardware-isolated (KVM) and can run any Docker image.
- **Fast Boot and Scalability**: Launches containers in milliseconds and supports scaling to thousands of machines.
- **Auto-Scaling and Scale to Zero**: Machines automatically scale to zero when idle, so you only pay for active usage.
- **User-Specific Routing**: Dynamic request routing allows each user or process to access their own sandboxed environment.
- **Persistent Storage**: Provides dedicated storage options via Fly Volumes, Fly Managed Postgres, and S3-compatible Tigris Data.
- **REST API Access**: Full control of Fly Machines via a REST API.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support**: Enables integration of sandboxes into LLM workflows using SSE.
- **Framework Support**: CLI can generate containers for popular frameworks (Rails, Phoenix, Django, Node, Laravel, .NET) even without a Dockerfile.
- **Secure by Default**: Memory-safe stack, hardware isolation, and direct deployment on Fly.io's own metal.
