## Description
figma-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that enables AI tools like Cursor to programmatically read and modify Figma designs. This allows for automation of UI/UX tasks through natural language instructions, bridging the gap between design and development by enabling seamless, real-time collaboration and synchronization between design and code.

## Features
- **Direct Design-to-Development Bridge:** Enables direct and standardized communication of design assets, specifications, and decisions between Figma and development environments.
- **Precise Communication of Design Intent:** Design elements (colors, dimensions, spacing, etc.) can be directly read by development tools, reducing manual documentation and communication errors.
- **Real-time Bidirectional Synchronization:** Design changes are immediately reflected in development environments and vice versa, supporting a collaborative workflow.
- **Design Validation and Quality Assurance:** Automated comparison of implemented UI with original designs, identifying discrepancies and providing objective quality metrics.
- **AI-Assisted Design Workflows:** Supports integration with AI tools (e.g., Galileo AI, UXPilot.ai, Codia.ai, Magician, Uizard) for:
  - Automated design generation based on text prompts
  - Data-driven design suggestions and optimization
  - Direct conversion of designs to frontend code
  - Real-time asset synchronization
  - Rapid prototyping from sketches
- **Automated Specification and Documentation:** Generates and synchronizes design documentation and specifications automatically, ensuring up-to-date references.
- **Version Control:** Manages versions and change history of design assets, supporting traceability.
- **Automated Testing:** Tests visual consistency across multiple breakpoints and device sizes.
- **Change Notification:** Automatically notifies development environments of design changes, streamlining updates.
- **Knowledge Base Integration:** Builds a searchable knowledge graph of design decisions, rationale, and user research, accessible to all team members.
- **Continuous Design and Validation:** Facilitates ongoing optimization based on user feedback, testing, and performance metrics.
- **Support for Agentic UX:** Prepares design systems and workflows to accommodate both human and AI agent interactions.
