## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard and protocol introduced by Anthropic in November 2024 for connecting AI assistants (such as large language models) with external data sources, tools, and systems. It provides a universal, model-agnostic interface for context exchange, enabling secure and standardized integrations between AI models and various software environments. MCP aims to simplify and unify the connection of AI models to data repositories, business tools, and development environments, addressing the complexity and fragmentation of previous integration methods.

## Features
- **Open Standard & Open Source**: MCP is fully open-sourced and based on open standards, with an active ecosystem and community.
- **Universal Protocol**: Provides a model-agnostic interface for connecting any AI assistant with any structured tool or data source.
- **Context Exchange**: Standardizes the way AI models read files, execute functions, and handle contextual prompts.
- **SDKs in Multiple Languages**: Official software development kits are available in Python, TypeScript, Java, and C#.
- **Pre-built MCP Servers**: Ready-to-use server implementations for popular enterprise systems are provided, with open-source repositories available on GitHub.
- **Custom Integration**: Developers can build custom MCP servers to connect proprietary or specialized data sources while maintaining compatibility with the MCP ecosystem.
- **Two-way Secure Connections**: Enables secure, bi-directional connectivity between AI-powered tools and data systems, respecting data access permissions.
- **Multi-Platform Adoption**: Supported by major AI providers including OpenAI (integrated into Agents SDK and planned for ChatGPT desktop app) and Google DeepMind (Gemini models), as well as other organizations like Block, Replit, and Sourcegraph.
- **Cloud Deployments**: MCP servers can be deployed to platforms like Cloudflare and integrated with Microsoft Semantic Kernel, Azure OpenAI, and more.
- **Applications**: Used for software development, business process automation, natural language automation, and connecting internal AI systems to proprietary knowledge bases and developer tools.

## Security Considerations
- In May 2025, security researchers highlighted issues with some MCP server implementations, such as insecure default configurations and unsafe command execution methods. Users and developers should review and secure their deployments accordingly.

## Pricing
- **Not specified.** MCP is an open standard and open-source project; usage is generally free, but enterprise support or enhanced offerings may depend on specific vendors or implementations.
