## Description
Design System MCP is a server implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that analyzes React component files and design tokens to provide accurate information about component properties and styling. It is primarily intended for UI code generation and integrating design systems.

## Features
- **MCP Server**: Provides a server that serves information about component props and design tokens via MCP.
- **Component Analysis**: Analyzes React component files to extract component properties.
- **Design Token Support**: Processes and serves design tokens, which are stored as JSON files.
- **Token Generation Workflow**: Utilizes Style Dictionary to process and generate design tokens for use in components.
- **Debugging Tools**: Includes scripts for debugging the MCP server, allowing users to test different components or token requests.
- **Generated Tokens Import**: Generated tokens can be imported into React components from the output directory.
