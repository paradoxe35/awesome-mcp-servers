## Description
mcp-neo4j is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Neo4j. It enables query execution, knowledge graph memory, and management of Neo4j Aura instances via the MCP protocol. MCP is designed to manage context between large language models (LLMs) and external systems, allowing natural language interaction with Neo4j databases and Aura accounts using compatible MCP clients.

## Features
- Implements the Model Context Protocol for integration between LLMs and Neo4j.
- Supports natural language to Cypher query translation (mcp-neo4j-cypher).
- Provides a knowledge graph memory system using Neo4j (mcp-neo4j-memory).
- Enables management of Neo4j Aura instances via MCP.
- Reference implementation for modeling memory as a knowledge graph.
- Can be used with various MCP clients, such as Claude Desktop, for natural language operations on Neo4j.

## Pricing
No pricing information is provided. The project appears to be open source.
