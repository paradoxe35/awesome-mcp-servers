## Description
OpenMCP is a tool designed to rapidly convert any web API into an MCP (Multi-Client Platform) server, enabling MCP clients to interact with various web APIs in a token-efficient manner. It supports integration with an open-source MCP server registry, allowing for the expansion of the MCP server network and broadening the range of services accessible to client applications, particularly LLMs (Large Language Models).

## Features
- **Rapid API Integration**: Quickly turns any web API into an MCP server, reportedly in as little as 10 seconds.
- **Multiple API Formats Supported**: Can convert APIs defined in REST (openapi.yaml/json), gRPC (service.proto), JSON-RPC (openrpc.json), GraphQL (schema.gql), SOAP (service.wsdl), and PostgREST (schema.sql).
- **Open-Source MCP Server Registry**: Integrates with a public registry of MCP servers, enabling discoverability and network expansion.
- **Local and Remote Hosting**: Offers both local and remote hosting options for MCP servers.
- **Client Integration**: Provides instructions for integrating with various clients, including Claude desktop and Cursor, allowing for tool loading and server enabling.
- **Flexible Installation**: Can be installed and run via CLI, or through npm with manual configuration.
- **Automation and Orchestration**: Designed for automated deployment and orchestration of MCP middleware.
