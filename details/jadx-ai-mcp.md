# JADX AI MCP

[JADX AI MCP](https://github.com/zinja-coder/jadx-ai-mcp) is an open-source plugin and MCP server for the JADX decompiler, designed to provide live reverse engineering and code analysis support using large language models (LLMs) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Features

- **JADX Integration**: Acts as a plugin for the JADX decompiler, extending its capabilities with AI-powered features.
- **MCP Server**: Includes a standalone Python MCP server that communicates with the plugin, enabling LLMs to analyze decompiled Android APKs in real-time.
- **Live Reverse Engineering Support**: Supports context-aware code review, AI-generated recommendations, and live interaction with LLMs such as Claude.
- **Automated Vulnerability Detection**: Utilizes LLMs to uncover vulnerabilities and provide security insights during APK analysis.
- **Reverse Engineering Helpers**: Offers tools and prompts for basic code understanding, static analysis, AI-powered code modification, documentation extraction, and metadata analysis.
- **Real-Time AI Integration**: Bridges the gap between local LLMs (e.g., running with Ollama) and MCP servers for fast, CLI-based workflows.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Supports prompts for code review, vulnerability detection, static analysis, and more.
- **GUI and Project Model Control**: Provides deep integration into the JADX GUI and project model for enhanced LLM workflows.
- **Open-source and Extensible**: Licensed under Apache 2.0 and built to be extended for new MCP tools and features.
- **Future Roadmap Includes**:
  - Support for apktool and hermes code (ReactNative applications)
  - Enhanced code modification capabilities
  - More MCP tools and prompt templates
  - Unified MCP server for various Android reverse engineering tools
