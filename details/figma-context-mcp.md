## Description
Figma-Context-MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides direct access to Figma layout and design information for AI coding agents such as Cursor. It enables one-shot design implementation by fetching, simplifying, and translating Figma data into relevant metadata and layout information suitable for code generation tools. 

## Features
- **Figma Data Access:** Allows coding agents to retrieve Figma file, frame, or group data directly via the Figma API.
- **AI Integration:** Designed specifically for use with AI-powered coding tools like Cursor, improving the accuracy of design implementation.
- **Context Simplification:** Simplifies and translates Figma API responses, providing only essential layout and styling metadata to AI models.
- **One-Shot Design Implementation:** Enables agents to implement designs in any framework in one step, reducing manual effort compared to using screenshots or manual copying.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Configuration examples provided for MacOS, Linux, and Windows environments.
- **Open Source:** Licensed under the MIT license and implemented primarily in TypeScript.
- **Custom Configuration:** Easily configured via standard MCP server configuration files in code editors or AI clients.
- **Logging and Error Handling:** Includes improved error logging for failed fetches and Figma response parsing for troubleshooting.

## Pricing
- **Open Source:** Available for free under the MIT license. There are no paid plans.

## Usage
- Requires a Figma API access token.
- Integrates with code editors or AI agents by adding the server configuration to the appropriate settings file.
