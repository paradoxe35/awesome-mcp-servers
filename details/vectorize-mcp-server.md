## Description
Vectorize MCP Server is an open-source implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Vectorize platform. It is designed to enable advanced semantic search and retrieval using natural language queries and is optimized for performance on large-scale vector datasets. The server supports efficient similarity matching using Approximate Nearest Neighbors algorithms and offers a range of customizable parameters for vector operations.

## Features
- **Semantic Search & Retrieval:** Supports natural language queries to retrieve relevant documents or data from vector databases.
- **Integration with Vectorize:** Works with the Vectorize platform for advanced vector-based operations.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbors Algorithms:** Utilizes efficient algorithms for similarity matching in large datasets.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows configuration of result counts and other retrieval options.
- **Text Extraction & Chunking:** Can extract text from documents (e.g., PDFs) and chunk them into Markdown format.
- **Deep Research:** Supports generating private deep research reports from pipelines, including optional web search.
- **API Tools:** Provides API endpoints for retrieve, extract, and deep-research operations.
- **VS Code Integration:** Supports one-click and manual installation for integration with VS Code and other editors (Claude, Windsurf, Cursor, Cline).
- **Open Source:** Licensed under MIT, with source code and contributions managed via GitHub.

## Installation & Configuration
- **NPM/NPX:** Can be run directly via npx or installed via npm.
- **Environment Variables:** Requires setting organization ID, token, and pipeline ID for operation.
- **VS Code & Editor Config:** Provides JSON configuration snippets for easy setup in various editors.

## Development
- Standard npm-based development workflow (install, run dev, release management).
- Contributions via GitHub pull requests.

## Pricing
- **Open Source:** No pricing; available under the MIT license.
