# VS Code Extension

[Source Code](https://github.com/square/goose-vscode)

## Description
The VS Code Extension for Goose AI integrates the Goose developer agent directly into Visual Studio Code. This allows developers to interact with the Goose agent for a range of code-related tasks, including code assistance, editing, testing, and automation, directly from the editor.

## Features
- **Integration with Goose AI agent**: Connects your VS Code environment to the Goose developer agent, which must be installed separately.
- **Ask Goose about code**: Highlight code and ask the agent questions or request actions using a dedicated panel or the "Ask Goose" command.
- **Code actions via Code Lens**: Use code lens/contextual menus to request code completions, edits, or other actions for specific code sections.
- **Automated code edits and testing**: Instruct Goose to make changes, test code, deploy, or perform other tasks in your project.
- **Quick fixes**: Request Goose to automatically fix detected problems in your code.
- **Terminal integration**: Open a Goose terminal inside VS Code to chat with the agent or issue commands.
- **Custom project hints**: Supports a `.goosehints` file in your project root to give Goose project-specific instructions (e.g., how to run or test your code).
- **Command-line actions**: Goose can run shell commands on your behalf to perform project operations.
- **Interruptible tasks**: You can interrupt Goose's ongoing tasks if needed.
- **Experimental and actively developed**: The extension is a work in progress and frequently updated.

## Requirements
- Goose AI agent must be installed separately for the extension to function.

## Installation
- Available directly from the VS Code marketplace.
