# Puppeteer-MCP

[Puppeteer-MCP](https://apidog.com/blog/puppeteer-mcp-server/) enables LLMs to automate and interact with web browsers using Puppeteer and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It is designed for advanced web automation, including web scraping, testing, and report generation.

## Features
- **Advanced Browser Automation:**
  - Natural language navigation: Instruct LLMs to visit URLs, search, and interact with elements.
  - Smart form interaction: Automate complex form submissions and dynamic field detection.
  - Multi-step workflows: Chain sequences like login → data extraction → report generation.
- **Intelligent Screenshot Capture:**
  - Context-aware screenshots (e.g., specific sections, lazy-loaded pages).
  - Visual diffing: Compare screenshots across different runs or deployments.
  - OCR integration: Extract text from images for further processing.
- **Dynamic JavaScript Execution:**
  - LLM-generated scripts for extracting or manipulating page content.
  - Real-time DOM manipulation and performance monitoring (e.g., Lighthouse scores).
- **Console Log Monitoring:**
  - AI-powered log analysis to find errors (e.g., 404s), detect patterns, and generate reports.
- **Configurable Browser Options:**
  - Control headless mode, slow-motion demo, and timeouts via environment variables.
- **Flexible Deployment:**
  - Install globally via npm, run with npx, or install from source for custom modifications.
- **Integration with Claude (and other LLM platforms):**
  - Easily configure as an MCP server in tools like Claude Desktop.

## Use Cases
- Web testing automation (simulate user interactions and verify behavior)
- Web scraping (extract dynamic data, capture screenshots)
- Documentation (automated UI state capture)
- Automated JavaScript execution in a browser context

## Security Best Practices
- Secure configuration files
- Restrict server access to authorized users
- Keep server and dependencies updated

## Pricing
No specific pricing information is provided in the available content. The tool appears to be open source and can be installed or run freely via npm or npx.
