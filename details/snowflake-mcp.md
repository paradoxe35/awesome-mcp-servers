# Snowflake MCP

**Category:** Database Messaging MCP Servers  
**Tags:** snowflake, database, ai-integration, mcp

## Description
Snowflake MCP is a server implementation that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to securely query and retrieve data from Snowflake data warehouses using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This enables AI-powered data analysis, report generation, and insights extraction directly from Snowflake, providing LLMs with access to up-to-date, proprietary enterprise data.

## Features
- **MCP Standard Compliance:** Implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing structured data requests and responses between LLMs and Snowflake.
- **Direct Data Access:** Translates MCP requests into Snowflake SQL queries and returns results in MCP-compliant format.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Supports configuration via environment variables or configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.yaml`).
- **Security:** Recommends key-pair authentication for secure connections; supports granular Snowflake permissions for controlled data access.
- **Customizable Setup:** Allows creation of dedicated users, roles, and warehouses within Snowflake for precise access management.
- **Open Source:** Source code available for review and customization.
- **Multi-language Support:** Can be run in environments supporting Go, Python, or Node.js (depending on the specific server implementation).
- **Logging:** Provides server-side logging for request tracking and troubleshooting.
- **Testing Tools:** Includes guidance for testing with tools like `curl` to verify MCP request handling and server responses.

## Usage
- Set up necessary Snowflake resources (users, roles, warehouses, permissions).
- Install required dependencies and clone the project repository.
- Configure the server with Snowflake connection details (preferably using secure authentication methods).
- Build and run the server application.
- Send MCP requests to the server endpoint to retrieve data from Snowflake.

## Security Considerations
- Strongly recommends key-pair authentication over password-based authentication.
- Advises against storing sensitive credentials in version control.
- Supports fine-grained permission management within Snowflake.

## Pricing
No pricing information is provided. The implementation appears to be open source and self-hosted.
