## Features

- **Two-way AI Integration:** Connects Claude AI to Jupyter Notebook using a WebSocket-based server for real-time communication.
- **Cell Manipulation:** Insert, execute, edit, and manage notebook cells programmatically.
- **Notebook Management:** Save notebooks and retrieve notebook and cell information.
- **Cell Execution:** Run specific cells or all cells in the notebook from Claude or external clients.
- **Output Retrieval:** Get output content (text or images) from executed cells, with options to limit text length.
- **Slideshow Support:** Set slide show types for notebook cells to facilitate presentations.
- **External Client Testing:** Includes a Python-based external client for interactive or batch testing of all available functions.
- **Compatibility:** Supports only Jupyter Notebook 6.x (not compatible with Jupyter Lab, v7.x, VS Code, or Google Colab).
- **Reconnection and Port Management:** Automatic reconnection and dynamic port allocation if default port is in use.
- **Security:** Runs arbitrary codeâ€”use with caution and ensure data backup.

### Available Tools via Claude AI
