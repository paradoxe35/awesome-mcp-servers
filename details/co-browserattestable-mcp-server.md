## Overview
`co-browser/attestable-mcp-server` is an MCP (Multi-Party Computation) server designed to run inside a trusted execution environment (TEE). It enables remote attestation and secure server verification for MCP clients, allowing verification that the server is running intended and untampered code.

## Features
- **Remote Attestation**: Supports remote attestation for MCP clients using RA-TLS, an extension to TLS that includes machine and code-specific measurements.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Runs within a TEE, generating a certificate that represents the currently running code.
- **SGX Integration**: Embeds an SGX quote in the X.509 certificate via a standardized extension, including the SGX report and complete Intel SGX certificate chain.
- **Evidence Claims**: The certificate contains evidence claims, notably a "pubkey-hash" claim with the hash of the ephemeral public key generated by the TEE.
- **Verification**: Clients can independently validate the attestation by building and running the code locally on emulated or secure hardware.
- **Signed Artifacts**: GitHub Actions build a Docker image inside a TEE and generate a signed attestation of the code. The resulting Docker image is signed by GitHub, and users can reproduce and verify the attestation independently.
- **Docker Support**: Provides Dockerfile and scripts for containerized deployment.
- **Local and Secure Hardware Support**: Can be started both on secure hardware and local development machines.
